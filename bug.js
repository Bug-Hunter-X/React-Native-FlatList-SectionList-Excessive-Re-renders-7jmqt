In React Native, when working with FlatList or SectionList, you might encounter an error where the component re-renders excessively, causing performance issues. This often happens when the `keyExtractor` prop isn't properly implemented or when data updates trigger unnecessary re-renders.  This can lead to lag, dropped frames and a poor user experience. Consider this code:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={data}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <MyComponent item={item} />}
/>
```

Without a `keyExtractor`, React Native might struggle to efficiently update the list.  Even worse, providing a bad `keyExtractor` will also lead to performance issues.
